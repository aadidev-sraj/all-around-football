      <h2>Italian Star Roberto Baggio’s Finale Penalty Miss</h2>
      <p>Roberto Baggio is arguably one of the greatest to play the game without ever winning the World Cup. It was in the 1994 World Cup that he came closest to lifting the coveted cup of life, that was until he dashed all his hopes by missing the decisive penalty shot.</p>

The 1952 Death Match featured the Nazi-backed star-studded German national team called Falkelf and Ukrainian prisoners of war, erstwhile footballers, called FC Start. It was a tremendous blow to the Nazi prestige that these bunch of malnourished prisoners went on to hammer the heck out of Flakelf, at every match and re-match.</p>

The world-famous photograph was dubbed “embrace of the soul” or El Abrazo del Alma, due to the man’s inability to physically hug Fillol Tarantini.</p>
